# Welcome to the Worldwide Restaurant Guide!

This is the final project for the course ["Git From Zero"](https://www.udemy.com/git-for-beginners-from-zero/) in Udemy.

## How it works

The idea is to have folders for each country, state/province and city. 

The country should be the country code as per the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) two letter country code. For example, "Venezuela" should be listed as "VE".

Then inside you add the state/province full name (if you don't see it already) and then add the full name of the city.

At that point you can either add or edit the "restaurants.md" markdown file, where you can add your favorite restaurant as follows:

```
[Restaurant Name] - [Type of cuisine]
[Brief description of why you liked it]
[Full address in one line]
[Phone number]
[Website (optional)]
```

And then leave an empty line to add another one.

You can take a look at any restaurants.md file to see a sample.

## Git procedure

You need to fork the repo first, then clone in your environment. Then you need to add or edit the appropriate restaurants.md file, commit and then submit a pull request.

Once I check your pull request and see that it's okay, I will add it to the main repository and will follow your username.

If you have any questions, please post it on the Udemy course forum or email me [jorge@fromzero.io](mailto:jorge@fromzero.io)

Happy coding!
