Nagy Levin Étterem (Restaurant Levin the Big)
Hungarian
Very clean and friendly restaurant, food is great. Highly recommended! 
  The style follows Jenõ Rejtõ's funny legionary books. Levin was a cook, a gourmand in one of  Rejtõ's books. 
  The restaurant can be found in one of the less beautiful outer districts, but it worths to go there.
