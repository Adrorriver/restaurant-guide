Circo - Italian
Everything in this restaurant is delicious. It's a little expensive, but totally worth it. I specially like their simple dishes, like the Bolognese Pasta.

Almond - French
Almond's atmosphere is great and they have the best brunch in the Flatiron district. If you're dining, do try the Steak Frites.
